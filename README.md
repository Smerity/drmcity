DRMCity
=======

I created [DRMCity](https://www.facebook.com/DRMCity) months before EA released SimCity but never finished it. The main reason was that I realised there'd be no momentum until EA released the monstrosity that they did.

Good news: the game didn't work on launch day and people are up in arms.  
Bad news: EA doesn't really seem to mind.

I thought it'd be nice to push the unfinished draft of the DRMCity landing page online for posterity.

+ The new SimCity will have *no* offline singleplayer
+ Your save games are stored *only* on the Internet
+ Once the servers stop, so will the new SimCity
